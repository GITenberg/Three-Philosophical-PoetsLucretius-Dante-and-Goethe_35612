description: ?I am no specialist in the study of Lucretius; I am not a Dante scholar
  nor a Goethe scholar?.My excuse for writing about them, notwithstanding, is merely
  the human excuse which every new poet has for writing about the spring. They have
  attracted me; they have moved me to reflection; they have revealed to me certain
  aspects of nature and of philosophy which I am prompted by mere sincerity to express,
  if anybody seems interested or willing to listen.? The modesty exhibited in the
  above disclaimer?from Santayana?s preface to Three Philosophical Poets?should be
  viewed in the context of the author?s extraordinary impact as a philosopher and
  teacher. The Sense of Beauty has claim to being the first major work on aesthetics
  written in the United States; the multivolume The Life of Reason is arguably the
  first extended analysis of pragmatism anywhere. Among Santayana?s many well-known
  Harvard students, Wallace Stevens has acknowledged a clear debt to his work. Based
  on a course Santayana taught at Harvard, Three Philosophical Poets was first delivered
  to the public as a series of lectures at Columbia University in 1910. Santayana?s
  lifelong, learned meditation on the relationship between philosophy and art is apparent.
  (Santayana?s own prose style has long been considered among the most eloquent in
  all of philosophy.) Here, he discusses the chief phases of European philosophy?naturalism,
  supernaturalism, and romanticism?as they are set forth and epitomized by the works
  of Lucretius, Dante, and Goethe, respectively. Praise for Three Philosophical Poets
  and its author ?[A] brilliant and admirable little book.? ?T. S. Eliot ?The exquisite
  and memorable way in which he has always said things has given so much delight that
  we accept what he says as we accept our own civilization. His pages are part of
  the douceur de vivre.? ?Wallace Stevens ?Santayana was the real excitement for me
  at Harvard, especially Three Philosophical Poets?.It really fixed my view of what
  poetry should ultimately be.? ?Conrad Aiken
